# Scooter Shooter for [MISTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
An FPGA implementation of Scooter Shooter for the MiSTer platform

## Credits
- Sorgelig: MiSTer project lead
- MiSTer-X: Original Konami 005849 design sourced from Green Beret core (https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Arcade-RushnAttack_MiSTer)
- Ace: Core design & 005849 tweaks
- JimmyStones: High score saving support & pause feature
- Kitrinx: ROM loader

## Features
- Logic modelled to match the original PCB design as closely as possible
- Standard joystick and keyboard controls
- High score saving (Can be saved manually or automatically - manual saving is the default)
- Greg Miller's cycle-accurate MC6809E CPU core with modifications by Sorgelig and bugfixes by Arnim Laeuger and Jotego
- T80s CPU by Daniel Wallner with fixes by MikeJ, Sorgelig, and others
- YM2203 implementation using JT03 by Jotego
- Audio filtering, including the PCB's switchable low-pass filters
- Option for normalized video timings to use with picky HDTVs and monitors (underclocks the game by ~1%)

## Installation
Place `*.rbf` into the "_Arcade/cores" folder on your SD card.  Then, place `*.mra` into the "_Arcade" folder and ROM files from MAME into "games/mame".

### ****ATTENTION****
ROMs are not included. In order to use this arcade core, you must provide the correct ROMs.

To simplify the process, .mra files are provided in the releases folder that specify the required ROMs along with their checksums.  The ROM's .zip filename refers to the corresponding file in the M.A.M.E. project.

Please refer to https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Arcade-Roms for information on how to setup and use the environment.

Quick reference for folders and file placement:

/_Arcade/<game name>.mra
/_Arcade/cores/<game rbf>.rbf
/games/mame/<mame rom>.zip
/games/hbmame/<hbmame rom>.zip

## Note regarding video output
The video output from Scooter Shooter has highly elevated gamma levels.  To correct this, apply gamma correction from within MiSTer's UI, Contrast Boost 3 recommended.

## High Score Save/Load
Save and load of high scores is supported for this core.

- To save your high scores manually, press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD.  High scores will be automatically loaded when the core is started.
- To enable automatic saving of high scores, turn on the 'Autosave Hiscores' option, press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD, and reload the core.  High scores will then be automatically saved (if they have changed) any time the OSD is opened.

High score data is stored in /media/fat/config/nvram/ as ```<mra filename>.nvm```
